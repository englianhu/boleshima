<pre><code>## [1] 360</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>##过滤重复开彩成绩

<p><em>数据图2.2：福彩3D开彩数据频率图</em></p>
<p>以 000 至 999 三位数随机变量，一般上会以普通频率分布分析，然而由于三位数字非出现在同一个单位（slot）里而是个别三个随机变量，因此<em>多变量泊松模式</em>将能分析。</p>

<h1>3. 数学模式</h1>
<ul>
<li><code>kfoots</code>程序包使用马克夫链，举例此期开彩010，该模式将分析及预测每当开彩该成绩后的下一个成绩（状态的转换率）的机率。</li>
<li><code>PoisNor</code>程序包提供多随机变量产生器及相关系数分析。</li>
